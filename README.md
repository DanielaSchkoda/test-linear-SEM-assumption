# Testing Linear SEM assumption
Implementation of four statistical tests to test the assumption that a distribution follows a linear structural equation model, which is often used as an a priori in  causal inference algorithms. The tests are using the following methods: 
* Rank statistic of Kleibergen and Paap (Frank Kleibergen and Richard Paap. “Generalized reduced rank tests using the singular value decomposition”. In: Journal of Econometrics 133.1 (2006), pp. 97– 126.)
* Rank statistic of Chen (Qihui Chen and Zheng Fang. “Improved inference on the rank of a matrix”. In: Quantitative Economics 10.4 (2019), pp. 1787–1824.)
* Incomplete U-statistic for testing polynomial constraints by Sturma, Drton and Leung (Nils Sturma, Mathias Drton, and Dennis Leung. Testing Many and Possibly Singular Polynomial Constraints. arXiv preprint. 2022. url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11756.)

Moreover, the repository contains simulations with the Tuebingen cause-effect pairs from the paper Joris M. Mooij et al. “Distinguishing Cause from Effect Using Observational Data: Methods and Benchmarks”. In: Journal of Machine Learning Research 17.32 (2016), pp. 1–102.
